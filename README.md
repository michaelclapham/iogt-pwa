## Local installation

#### Activate your virtual environment (backend)

$ virtualenv iogt
$ source iogt/bin/activate
```

#### Install necessary dependencies & setup database (backend)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unicef/iogt-pwa.git
cd iogt-pwa/iogt
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

The demo site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and the Wagtail admin
interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).

Log into the admin with the credentials you set while creating the superuser account.

Use `Ctrl+c` to stop the local server. 



#### Setup yarn package manager (Depends on [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) environment)
```bash
# May require administrator privileges to the command
npm install -g yarn 
```
#### Install necessary dependencies in a separate terminal window (frontend)
```bash

# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

Once the server has started, it will print a local development URL to open in your browser. Now you're ready to test drive IoGT website!
